!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This repo holds Tamtam (an small low-cost humanoid).
It will contain all the documentation needed to build that litte
robot.
It will have about 19 DOF, those will be mg90s. I expect to finish it very
son. Since now I have done a big part of the hardware, just need some more
time to finish the last pieces and to  set up the electronical part.

I'll also will publish the code,and there will be the possibility of
adding a raspberry pi zero, but I'm still working on it


the robot is 223.25 mm hight
