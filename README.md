!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This repo holds Tamtam (an small low-cost humanoid).
It will contain all the documentation needed to build that litte
robot.
It will have about 19 DOF, those will be mg90s. I expect to finish it very
son. Since now I have done a big part of the hardware, the electronics are 
working fine (the bluetooth and the eyes control is working) and the I've 
already computed the inverse kinematics, just need a little more time to finish
the last pieces.

I'll also will publish the code,and there will be the possibility of
adding a raspberry pi zero, but I've not worked on it yet.


the robot is 223.25 mm hight
